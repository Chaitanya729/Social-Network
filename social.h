/**
 * @file social.h
 * @brief Header file for the Social Network program.
 * @details This file contains structure definitions and function prototypes for implementing
 * functionalities related to nodes in a social network.
 *
 * Program Overview:
 * -----------------
 * The Social Network program manages nodes representing individuals, groups, businesses, and organizations.
 * It provides functionalities for creating and deleting nodes, searching for nodes, posting content, and
 * exploring relationships between nodes.
 *
 * Structures:
 * -----------
 * - individual: Represents an individual node with attributes like ID, name, creation date, content, and birthday.
 * - group, business, organization: Similar structures with additional attributes as per their types.
 * - date: Structure for representing a date with day, month, and year.
 *
 * Functions:
 * -----------
 * - name_input(): Takes user input for the name string.
 * - date_input(): Takes user input for a date structure.
 * - content_input(): Takes user input for the content string.
 * - birthday_input(): Takes user input for a birthday structure.
 * - print_node(): Prints the attributes of a given node.
 * - search(): Searches and prints nodes based on a given parameter.
 * - search_by_id(): Searches and returns a node based on its ID.
 * - search_by_birthday(): Searches and prints nodes based on a given birthday.
 * - print_content(): Prints the content of a node with a given ID.
 * - search_to_link(): Searches for a node with matching parameters and links it.
 * - new_node(): Creates a new node of all types.
 * - one_hop(): Prints one-hop nodes for a node with a given ID.
 * - swap_nodes(): Swaps content between two nodes.
 * - two_hop(): Prints two-hop nodes for a given individual node.
 * - add_content(): Adds content to a node.
 * - search_for_content(): Searches and prints nodes with content containing a given string.
 * - print_all(): Prints all nodes in the system.
 * - delete_node(): Deletes a node from the system.
 *
 * @note All structures and function prototypes are defined in this header file.
